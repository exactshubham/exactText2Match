## Objective:
Create a web app that uses a search input and any Free Image
API to display Images. One can then add some custom style Captions on
the Images and give a download button that will download the updated
image with a Caption.

## Algorithm:
->Design a search page, which will consist of an input box to search for any
keyword and a thumbnail like a result area were the results of the search
the query will be displayed.
[Design the page to the best of your skills, this would test your HTML &
CSS Skills]

->Once a user enters any keyword into the search box and hits the search
button. Perform a search using any Free Image Api {List Given Below}. I recommend their API because it is Free with some usages Limit, and you wonâ€™t have to worry about many configurations when trying to request data.
[Create this in a functional-based component with Proper Error
Handling, Error Reporting and Validation]

->Display the results on the search page in a thumbnail-like structure.
Also, create a button named "Add Captions" below every result.
[Design this to the best of your HTML & CSS Skills]

->Clicking on the "Add Captions" button will take the user to a different
page, which will have a default blank canvas. Display the image on the
canvas.
[Use a third-party plugin called fabric.js to display images on canvas]

->Display A button named "Add Captions" Adjacent to Canvas and an
Options to add Shapes on Image. Only Add Four shapes: Triangle, Circle,
Rectangle, Polygon
[Use fabric.js, it has default options to add Shapes. Use your designing
skills to design the area]

->Clicking on shapes will add the shaper Layer above the Image on the
Canvas. And Clicking on Add Captions will add Text Layer above the Image
on the Canvas.
[use Fabric.js to add Shapes and Text Layer to add on canvas]

->User, can edit the texts, Resize the text, Can Add Multiple Text
Layers, Can Drag & re-position the text layer. Shape Layer can be
resized, repositioned and dragged and multiple shapes can be added.
[Fabric .js has all these options by default]

->Create a button named "Download" Adjacent to the Canvas. Clicking on
that button will download the new Image with updated texts and Shapes

->Bonus Point: Console.log all the layers of the Canvas with their
values in an array format in order of their occurrence. for example: if I
had the Image layer at the bottom, then Shape Layer and then Text Layer then the Array would be [Image][Shape][Text]
